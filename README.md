## Getting Started
### Requirements
* Docker Engine [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* Java OpenJDK 11+  [Installation Guide](https://openjdk.org/install/)

### Build
```sh
./gradlew clean build
```

### Source file structure
This project aims to have a multiple-module/pipeline, to achieve that, every pipeline should be something like this [sample-aggregation](/tree/main/sample-aggregation)
This project have a few files:

* The main `/src/main/kotlin`
  * [App.kt](https://github.com/arthurpessoa/kotlin-beam-starter/blob/main/sample-aggregation/src/main/kotlin/io/github/arthurpessoa/App.kt) Defines the main() entrypoint
  * [/schema](https://github.com/arthurpessoa/kotlin-beam-starter/blob/main/sample-aggregation/src/main/kotlin/io/github/arthurpessoa/schema) Contains all schema definitions
  * [/pipeline](https://github.com/arthurpessoa/kotlin-beam-starter/blob/main/sample-aggregation/src/main/kotlin/io/github/arthurpessoa/pipeline) Contains the pipeline definition
  * [/ptranform](https://github.com/arthurpessoa/kotlin-beam-starter/blob/main/sample-aggregation/src/main/kotlin/io/github/arthurpessoa/pipeline) Contains all the pipeline transformations (ptransforms)
* The test `src/test/kotlin` defines the unit tests
* The test `src/integrationTest/kotlin` defines the integration tests

### How can i use another runner?
> To keep this template small, it only includes the [Direct Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/direct/) for runtime tests, and [Spark Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/spark/) as a integration test example.
> For a comparison of what each runner currently supports, look at the Beam [Capability Matrix](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/).
> To add a new runner, visit the runner's page for instructions on how to include it.

### What X means? (Glossary)

> **Pipeline**: A Pipeline encapsulates your entire data processing task, from start to finish. This includes reading input data, transforming that data, and writing output data. All Beam driver programs must create a Pipeline. When you create the Pipeline, you must also specify the execution options that tell the Pipeline where and how to run.

> **PCollection**: A PCollection represents a distributed data set that your Beam pipeline operates on. The data set can be bounded, meaning it comes from a fixed source like a file, or unbounded, meaning it comes from a continuously updating source via a subscription or other mechanism. Your pipeline typically creates an initial PCollection by reading data from an external data source, but you can also create a PCollection from in-memory data within your driver program. From there, PCollections are the inputs and outputs for each step in your pipeline.

> **PTransform**: A PTransform represents a data processing operation, or a step, in your pipeline. Every PTransform takes one or more PCollection objects as input, performs a processing function that you provide on the elements of that PCollection, and produces zero or more output PCollection objects.
